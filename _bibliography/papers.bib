  abstract={Some web browsers working on certain operating systems (OSs) specify that a single-word search query entered into the search bar be sent to the recursive resolver of the domain name system (DNS) as a DNS request that includes the word. Such behavior is unexpected for users and induces privacy concerns through single-word search query leakage. We present our survey on the conditions during which this behavior occurs. By analyzing the DNS traffic captured at the recursive resolvers, we demonstrate that a considerable number of queries are leaked and the interests of individuals or organizations can be inferred through passive eavesdroppers.}
